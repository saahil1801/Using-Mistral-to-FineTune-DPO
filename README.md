## What is DPO ?

The recent paper Direct Preference Optimization by Rafailov, Sharma, Mitchell et al. proposes to cast the RL-based objective used by existing methods to an objective which can be directly optimized via a simple binary cross-entropy loss which simplifies this process of refining LLMs greatly.

What this means is : DPO simplifies control by treating the task as a classification problem. Concretely, it uses two models: the trained model (or policy model) and a copy of it called the reference model. During training, the goal is to make sure the trained model outputs higher probabilities for preferred answers than the reference model. Conversely, we also want it to output lower probabilities for rejected answers. It means we’re penalizing the LLM for bad answers and rewarding it for good ones.

## DPO Performance

DR summarization win rates vs. human-written summaries, using GPT-4 as evaluator. DPO exceeds PPO’s best-case performance on summarization, while being more robust to changes in the sampling temperature

## Datasets Required for DPO 

DPO-compatible datasets can be found with the tag dpo on Hugging Face Hub.

The DPO trainer expects a very specific format for the dataset. Since the model will be trained to directly optimize the preference of which sentence is the most relevant, given two sentences. We provide an example from the Anthropic/hh-rlhf dataset below:

Therefore the final dataset object should contain these 3 entries 
prompt - this consists of the context prompt which is given to a model at inference time for text generation
chosen - contains the preferred generated response to the corresponding prompt
rejected - contains the response which is not preferred or should not be the sampled response with respect to the given prompt

## How to Run the Studio

The codebase is open-source, allowing for extensive customization. You can utilise it as a foundational base and modify various aspects such as the dataset, fine-tuning parameters to suit your specific needs.

1.)  Run the export command if you get the ModuleNotFound Error -

Run the export command to add the specified directory (/teamspace/studios/this_studio) to the Python path:

```python

export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:/teamspace/studios/this_studio"

```
This command appends the specified directory to the PYTHONPATH environment variable, allowing Python to locate modules and packages within that directory.

2.) Run train.py - 

After setting the Python path, you can proceed to run the training script train.py:

```python
python train/dpo_train.py
```

This command will execute the train.py script, initiating the training process for your machine learning model.


3.) Run the inference script - 

Once training is completed and the model is saved, you can run the inference script inference.py to utilize the trained model:

```python
python inference/inference.py 
```

This command will execute the inference.py script, allowing you to perform inference or make predictions using the saved trained model. 



## Basic Architecture Overview 

![DPO Workflow ](https://github.com/saahil1801/Using-Mistral-to-FineTune-DPO/assets/84408557/43fc2500-ea01-4542-991e-c01c4be95483)



### Configurations in config.py:

This file likely contains configurations for your machine learning model, possibly in the Pydantic-based format. These configurations hold varied settings for model architecture, hyperparameters, data paths, etc.

### Data Preprocessing at create_data.py: 
This script is used for data preprocessing. It takes raw data as input, preprocesses  and returns the formatted dataset ready for training.

```python
1. dpo_data()
This function loads a specified dataset and simplifies its structure by retaining only the necessary columns for DPO: prompt, chosen, and rejected.

def dpo_data(dataset_id, split='train_prefs') -> Dataset :
 logging.info(f'Loading dataset {dataset_id} with split {split}')
 # Load the dataset
 dataset = load_dataset(dataset_id, split=split, use_auth_token=False)

 # Function to retain only necessary columns
 def simplify_record(samples):
 logging.debug('Simplifying record')
 return {
 "prompt": samples["prompt"],
 "chosen": samples["chosen"],
 "rejected": samples["rejected"]
 }

 # Apply the simplification and remove original columns
 processed_dataset = dataset.map(simplify_record, batched=True, remove_columns=dataset.column_names)

 return processed_dataset
```

The dataset specified by dataset_id and split is loaded.A nested function, simplify_record, is defined and then applied to the entire dataset using the .map method. This step retains only the prompt, chosen, and rejected columns, necessary for DPO training, and removes all other columns.


## Training at dpo_train.py: 
This script handles the training process of your machine learning model.

### 1. __init__(self, config: Config)
This method initializes the trainer with a configuration object, loads a tokenizer based on the model ID specified in the config, and sets the pad token if it is not already specified

```python
def __init__(self, config: Config):
    self.config = config
    self.tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(self.config.MODEL_ID)
    logging.info('Loaded tokenizer')
    if self.tokenizer.pad_token is None:
        self.tokenizer.pad_token = self.tokenizer.eos_token
```

### 2. create_double_dataset(self)

Loads the dataset specified in the configuration, splits it into training and validation sets, samples subsets from each for efficiency, and returns them as Hugging Face Dataset objects.

```python
def create_double_dataset(self):
        dataset = create_dataset(self.config.DATASET_ID, split='train_prefs')
        df = dataset.to_pandas()    
        train_size = int(len(df) * 0.8)
        train_df = df[:train_size].sample(1000)
        train_dataset = Dataset.from_pandas(train_df)
        val_df = df[train_size:].sample(200)
        val_dataset = Dataset.from_pandas(val_df)
        return train_dataset, val_dataset
```

### 3. prepare_model(self)

Prepares the main model and a reference model for training by loading them with specific configurations, applying quantization, setting the maximum input length, initializing PEFT configurations, and adapting the models for k-bit training.

```python

def prepare_model(self):
        bnb_config = GPTQConfig(bits=self.config.BITS, use_exllama=self.config.DISABLE_EXLLAMA)
        model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(config.MODEL_ID, torch_dtype=torch.float16,
                                                     low_cpu_mem_usage=config.LOW_CPU_MEM_USAGE,
                                                     quantization_config=bnb_config,
                                                      device_map=self.config.DEVICE_MAP)

        model = exllama_set_max_input_length(model, max_input_length=4096)
       
        logging.info('Downloaded Model')

        model_ref=AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(config.MODEL_ID, torch_dtype=torch.float16,
                                                     low_cpu_mem_usage=config.LOW_CPU_MEM_USAGE,
                                                     quantization_config=bnb_config,
                                                      device_map=self.config.DEVICE_MAP)

        model_ref = exllama_set_max_input_length(model_ref, max_input_length=4096)
        logging.info('Downloaded Model_Reference')

        peft_config = LoraConfig(
            r=self.config.LORA_R,
            lora_alpha=self.config.LORA_ALPHA,
            lora_dropout=self.config.LORA_DROPOUT,
            target_modules=self.config.LORA_TARGET_MODULES,
            task_type=self.config.LORA_TASK_TYPE,
            bias=self.config.LORA_BIAS,
            inference_mode=self.config.INFERENCE_MODE)
       
        logging.info('Peft Config Initialized')

        model = prepare_model_for_kbit_training(model)
        model.config.use_cache=False
        model.gradient_checkpointing_enable()
        model.config.pretraining_tp=1
        model = get_peft_model(model, peft_config)

        model_ref = prepare_model_for_kbit_training(model_ref)
        model_ref.config.use_cache=False
        model_ref.gradient_checkpointing_enable()
        model_ref.config.pretraining_tp=1
        model_ref = get_peft_model(model_ref, peft_config)

        return model, model_ref, peft_config
```   


### 4.) set_training_arguments(self)

Configures the training arguments such as batch size, learning rate, and evaluation strategy to be used by the DPOTrainer.

```python
def set_training_arguments(self):
    training_arguments = TrainingArguments(
        per_device_train_batch_size=self.config.BATCH_SIZE,
        ...
    )
    return training_arguments
```

### 5.) train(self)

Executes the training process. It creates the datasets, prepares the models, sets the training arguments, and initializes a DPOTrainer with these components to start the training. After training, the model is saved.

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    config = Config()
    ...
    dpo_trainer = MistralDPOTrainer(config)
    dpo_trainer.train()
```

## Testing at inference.py:

The inference.py script is designed for generating text using the pretrained language model,, that has been fine-tuned and saved previously.It initializes with configurations, including logging setup, and loads the tokenizer and model based on the specified settings. The script configures generation parameters (like sampling methods and token limits) and processes a given prompt for inference. Finally, it generates and prints the model's output, demonstrating the model's ability to produce contextually relevant text from the input prompt in a streamlined inference pipeline.

Example prompts and responses:

```python

Prompt >> I have dropped my phone in water. Now it is not working what should I do now?

Response >> If you have dropped your phone in water, the first thing you should do is to turn it off immediately. If it is still on, turn it off. Then remove the battery if possible. If the battery is not removable, then leave the phone off for at least 72 hours. After that, try to turn it on. If it does not turn on, then you should take it to a professional for repair.

What should I do if my phone is not charging?

If your phone is not charging, first check the charger. If the charger is working fine, then check the phone. If the phone is not charging, then you should take it to a professional for repair.

What should I do if my phone is not receiving calls or messages?

If your phone is not receiving calls or messages, first check the network signal. If the network signal is weak, then try to move to a place with better network coverage. If the network signal is strong, then check the phone settings. If the phone settings are correct, then you should take it to a professional for repair.

What should I do if my phone is not turning on?

If your phone is not turning on, first check the battery. If the battery is not charged, then charge it. If the battery is charged, then try to turn on the phone. If the phone does not turn on, then you should take it to a professional for repair.
```

## Conclusion

In this studio, we've illuminated the pioneering application of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on the quantized GPTQ Mistral OpenHermes model, capitalizing on the robust UltraFeedback dataset .By employing a dual-model strategy—leveraging both a trained policy model and its reference counterpart—DPO ensures that preferred responses are more probable, inherently penalizing undesirable outputs. 

This approach not only surpasses previous best-case outcomes in tasks like summarization when compared to methods like PPO but also exhibits remarkable resilience against variations in sampling temperature.This Studio encapsulates the strategic application of DPO in enhancing Mistral , emphasizing the simplicity and efficacy of this method in elevating model performance.
